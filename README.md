## Rust Decimal to Binary Converter 
### A simple command-line tool for converting decimal numbers to binary.

<hr />

This repository contains a Rust implementation of a decimal to binary converter, inspired by my previous [C version](https://github.com/LuMarans30/three-version-decimal-to-binary). 
I'm using this project to learn Rust and explore its features.
